<pre Class="lyrics">



      Windy day, blow me away. 
      Windy day, blow me away. 

      Windy day, blow me away.
      Windy day, this place is not the same. 

      Windy day, blow me away. 
      Windy day, blow me away. 
      I need you to get me out of here,
      Things in this place are not the same. 
      Please take me away, away, away.

      Windy day, blow me away. 
      Windy day, blow me away. 

      Windy day, blow me away.
      Windy day, this place is not the same. 
      I need you to get me out of here, everything is wrong 
      Pick me up with your strong gust, take me far away  
      Windy day, get me out of here, everything is wrong
      Pick me up with your strong gust, don't let me fall
      
      Windy day, blow me away.
      Windy day, this place is not the same. 
      Pick me up with your strong gust, take me far away  
      Windy day, get me out of here, don't let me fall
      I need you to get me out of here, everything is wrong 
      Pick me up with your strong gust, take me far away
